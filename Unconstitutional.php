                            hid it. The Constitution protected the “property” of those who enslaved black
                            people, prohibited the federal government from intervening to end importation of
                            enslaved Africans for 20 years, allowed Congress to mobilize the militia to put down
                            insurrections by the enslaved, and forced states that had outlawed slavery to turn
                            over enslaved people who had run away seeking refuge. </p>

                            evidently chosen to conceal from Europe, that in this enlightened country, the practice of

                            failure of term limits for federal officers and failure to protect civil liberties, writing
                            “our liberty depends on the freedom of the press.” Yet in criminal neglect of duty, the ex
                            parte Constitution machine deliberately failed to provide for its own enforcement, instead
                            outrageously “relying” on the media to act as law enforcement.

                        <p>a. The ratification process violated the Articles of Confederation, the existing governing
                            doctrine that provided it was perpetual and required confirmation by every state legislature
                            to any alteration. Article VII of the Constitution violated these provisions in many ways.
                            It authorized scrapping the “perpetual Union” upon approval of only nine states of the 13
                            states, upon approval of state conventions rather than state legislatures, and without the
                            agreement of Congress. </p>

                        <p> b. Holdout states were threatened with economic retaliation and collapse if they did not go
                            along. Rhode Island, the last state to ratify the Constitution, did so only after Congress
                            threatened a trade embargo and a majority of its delegates disobeyed explicit instructions
                            from their constituents. It it is doubtful that the Constitution would have been ratified if
                            Massachusetts had voted “no,” and its “yes” vote was crucially influenced by Governor John
                            Hancock’s endorsement, apparently secured by the promise of leading Federalists to support
                            his candidacy in the next gubernatorial election. </p>

                        <p> <span>• </span>	In a letter to James Madison he states “The question whether one generation of men has a right to bind another, seems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water… (But) between society and society, or generation and generation there is no municipal obligation, no umpire but the law of nature. We seem not to have perceived that, by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independent nation to another…on similar ground it may be proved no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation…Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years.  If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force and not of right.”
