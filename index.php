                        and became a highly successful real estate
                        broker and Vice President of Corcoran, a prestigious national real

                    <p>Barbara has experienced personally and first-hand the criminality and corruption infested
                        in the government. Barbara's indoctrination into the staggering government tyranny began
                        when she and her mother became prey to the U. S. Guardian Genocide Regime (<span

                        <span>).</span>
                        In the process, Barbara personally experienced the staggering criminality, tyranny and
                        corruption infested in all government branches both on the state and federal levels and
                        throughout all echelons of government including the President, Presidential Cabinet, U.S.
                        SupremeCourt, Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, F.B.I., D.O.J. and their state
                        judicial, legislative, executive and law enforcement counterparts. The more depraved the
                        crimes of a government employee, the higher up he is promoted in the hierarchy of the
                        government crime chain.
                    </p>

                    <p> Barbara is an outspoken Whistleblower of the unbridled atrocities, abuse of power and
                        self-serving schemes of “political criminals” who use their government office to transfer
                        the wealth of the taxpayer public to themselves and their “special interest” “special pac”
                        donors. The Supreme Court is nothing more than a political operative and the protection arm
                        of government tyrants and criminals. In furtherance of and in conspiracy with the lawless,
                        government tyrants, theU.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of illegal, void, null so
                        called “opinions” that purport to“legitimize” bribery by government officials.Prolific

                    <p>The U.S. Guardian and Child Sex/Human Trafficking Rackets have spawn a vast, industry of rackets
                        against family members (“Inextricably Intertwined Rackets”).</p>
                    <p>The Inextricably Intertwined Rackets are carried out in other lawless, collusive, crime
                        syndicates falsely called “courts” to protect, cover up, debilitate, rape the rights of and
                        destroy the lives of family members to silence exposure and render them indigent so they must
                        struggle for their own financial survival and unable to fight the underlying Racket. Insert Link
                        here to Section titled “U.S. Inextricably Intertwined Rackets”</p>
                    <p>These Inextricably Intertwined Rackets use such names as “bankruptcy” “foreclosure” “criminal”
                        “probate” “civil” to perpetrate a separate string of Atrocity Crimes including:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Forcing Family Member Crime Victims into bankruptcy and foreclosure where their own homes and
                        assets are stolen and they are extorted by fabricated “court” “attorney” and other RICO “fees”;
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Sued in fraudulent lawsuits known a “SLAPP lawsuits” where they are falsely accusing them of
                        “defamation” when they truthfully report the Crimes;</p>
                    <p>3. Maliciously prosecuted and falsely arrested for invented “crimes” such as:
                        a. “Contempt of Court” by being falsely accused of “violating” illegal, void rights raping
                        edicts by judicial criminals that strip them of their Rights to protect their loved ones and
                        report crimes;
                        b. “Interference with “custody” of their own parent or child to orchestrate their false arrest
                        when family members attempt to protect their loved ones from the Atrocity Crimes. “Custody” is
                        another fabricated code word to absurdly imply someone can be stripped/raped of their
                        Inalienable Birth Rights and held in “Civil Custody.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Subjected to illegal, void so called “orders” called “gag orders” to silence them from
                        reporting crimes. These so called “gag orders” actually constitute crimes of blackmail and
                        extortion. Insert Link with Appendix of Crimes.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Subjected to “Extortion and Rights Raping Edicts” called by such code words as “Supervision”
                        or “Visitation” Orders; </p>
                    <p>6. Issued “no action letters” by aiding, abetting and colluding judicial government employees
                        including “appellate courts”, “attorney and judicial oversight committees” and their protection
                        arm, the “law enforcement agencies.”</p>
                    <p>When Family Members first become a Crime Victim, they are unaware the U.S. Guardian Genocide
                        Racket and Child Sex/Human Trafficking Racket are deliberate systemic Atrocity Crimes. As is the
                        intention of these rackets, they initially believe their “matter” could not possibly be anything
                        other than “isolated” crimes because of something they may have done. And that “IF” the next
                        tier of courts or oversight government officials were informed, they would find remedy. Thus
                        they are extorted to hemorrhage fees on “court costs” and attorneys who are part of the racket.
                        As they wade through a deliberate minefield of obstacles and subjected to cover up, retaliation
                        and escalated attacks, they realize they are embroiled in a systemic web and any attempt at
                        remedy is futile as they are embroiled in an organized crime syndicate.</p>

                        <p>1. Private Prisons conjured by government employees in collusion with such companies as GEO
                            where victims are human trafficked by false incarceration to benefit private companies in
                            which government employees are secretly invested.

                            criminals who sent
                            children to detention centers in which they were invested, openly run and abetted for years
                            by all government branches destroying the lives of thousands of families;
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Eco-Genocide Environment Rackets run in conspiracy with toxic companies like Chevron that
                            pollute and destroy the environment and collude with judicial criminals to prosecute,
                            terrorize and torture those who expose them; </p>
                        <p>4. Nuremberg Code Crimes by Big Pharma euthanasia companies such as Johnson and Johnson,
                            Moderna and Pfizer using an unending series of “vaccines” that likely produce their own
                            “Mutants” requiring further “vaccines” to pretend to cure a newly discovered unscientific
                            “Covid” disease while making billions but are unable to create a cure for long festering
                            scientific diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes. </p>
                        <p>5. Illegal “Protection Sounding Laws” like the “Patriot Act” used to cover up secret illegal
                            surveillance and torture those like Julian Assange who expose that these illegal “laws” are
                            “Crimes of Aggression” under international laws. In retaliation, Assange was Forcibly
                            Disappeared, restrained in a dungeon reminiscent of the barbaric medieval ages. In the
                            ultimate irony, Assange sought to remain in a dungeon instead of returned to the U.S. to be
                            criminalized for the crimes of the U.S. government.

                    <p>We are MILLIONS of families all over the U.S. and the world whose parents, children and spouses

                        stolen, kidnapped, trafficked and murdered by predators and grifters paid by and under the

                        legitimate “laws.” The agenda of these U.S. Atrocity Crimes is to secret their Crime Victims
                        away
                        from their family and the world in order to operate a profiteering slave trade industry using

                        <p>The Constitution was written in 1787 for an Agrarian Slave Society.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution held sacred was fatally flawed at its inception. Even its founders were

                            different than stubbornly persisting in using a horse and buggy, antiquated 1787
                            medicalcures or ignoring technology. </p>
                        <p>As the Constitution is premised on the continuing consent of the governed, when the state no
                            longer protects the rights it was intended to preserve, the consent is vitiated. When
                            governments violate those rights, its citizens have the right to take up arms.</p>

                    moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of Democracy? Is ours a 'government of the people by the

                            the
                            rise of strongmen and demagogues, ascendency of profit-driven politics over deep-seated

                            basic human rights and dignity and silence of people who should know better. The
                            government
                            has ripped the Constitution to shreds and left us powerless in the face of its power

                            collective, systematic, strategic, and permanent. It is a system in which all the
                            high-level
                            government officials are complicit, where they deliberately work to enrich themselves,
                            and
                            then use their accumulated wealth to perpetuate themselves in power. Kakistocracies
                            (literally, governments by the worst) proliferate in weak and disorganized political
                            systems
                            that repel the talented and attract the inept and most debased.
