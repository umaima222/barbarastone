                        <p>
                            Hello America and World – my name is Barbara Stone.<br />
                            I have announced my candidacy for President of the U.S. I am choosing to run for President as I
                            have respect and honor for the People of this Country. I am outraged as a Citizen of the U.S.
                            and the world about how the lives and very essence of humanity of those who have believed in,
                            toiled and built this country has become defiled and destroyed by government servants in every
                            branch of government. The crimes by government servants are rampant as there are no consequences
                            for them.<br /><br />
                            Our country is completely lawless in every arena - our right to free speech is censored, our
                            right to privacy is invaded, our liberty is threatened by false incarceration as the government
                            runs a racket by profiting from the jail system and there are countless other
                            rackets.<br /><br />
                            But nowhere is the tyrannical U.S. government more brazenly on display than with regard to our
                            basic human and family rights and the destruction of our lives under the guise of family court
                            and guardian court.<br /><br />
                            Our rights are Unalienable and endowed by the Creator under the Declaration of Independence and
                            derived from Human Dignity under the UN. Universal Declaration of Human rights. They are not
                            "civil" or "constitutional rights" - they are our Unalienable birthrights that we own because we
                            were born and exist.<br /><br />
                            Protecting our Human Rights is the fundamental function for governments. Reclaiming and
                            protecting our human rights is the essence of my campaign and the reason I am running for
                            President.<br /><br />
                            I am an expert on government tyranny as I have experienced it first hand as a victim while
                            seeking futile remedy to protect my mother from being human trafficked in the guise of
                            “guardianship” and as a prior attorney who has been viciously retaliated for being a
                            whistleblower.<br /><br />
                            The U.S. is at War against Humanity. That is why I am running for President. There is no one in
                            or seeking office except myself who will speak Truth to Tyranny, must less articulate a Platform
                            to bring to light and remedy the U.S. War on Humanity and restore and protect the rights of We
                            the People.

                        unconstitutional laws to cover up loopholes.

                        children to thrive and prosper. We the People’s, ourselves, are the only ones who can make this
                        happen.

                    <p> 5. We the People’s must adopt and ratify the international, universal laws of the United Nations to
                        become a true international leader, to lead the world by actions, not by hypocrisy.
                    </p>
                    <p> 6. We the People’s must demand that international agencies including the U.N. Human Rights
                        Council, the U.N. Security Council, the International Criminal Court and NATO comply with their own
                        Charters and Conventions; repeal and nullify all provisions therein that strip our Unalienable

                    <p>The U.S. Guardian and Child Sex/Human Trafficking Rackets have spawn a vast, industry of rackets
                        against family members (“Inextricably Intertwined Rackets”).</p>
                    <p>The Inextricably Intertwined Rackets are carried out in other lawless, collusive, crime
                        syndicates falsely called “courts” to protect, cover up, debilitate, rape the rights of and
                        destroy the lives of family members to financially profit from embroiling them in other court
                        rackets. These Inextricably Intertwined Rackets also serve to silence exposure and render family
                        members indigent so they must struggle for their own financial survival and unable to fight the
                        underlying Racket</p>
                    <p>These Inextricably Intertwined Rackets use such names as “bankruptcy” “foreclosure” “criminal”
                        “probate” “civil” to perpetrate a separate string of Atrocity Crimes including:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Forcing Family Member Crime Victims into bankruptcy and foreclosure where their own homes and
                        assets are stolen and they are extorted by fabricated “court” “attorney” and other RICO “fees”;
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Sued in fraudulent lawsuits known a “SLAPP lawsuits” where they are falsely accusing them of
                        “defamation” when they truthfully report the Crimes;</p>
                    <p>3. Maliciously prosecuted and falsely arrested for invented “crimes” such as:<br /><br />
                        a. “Contempt of Court” by being falsely accused of “violating” illegal, void rights raping
                        edicts by judicial criminals that strip them of their Rights to protect their loved ones and
                        report crimes;<br />
                        b. “Interference with “custody” of their own parent or child to orchestrate their false arrest
                        when family members attempt to protect their loved ones from the Atrocity Crimes. “Custody” is
                        another fabricated code word to absurdly imply someone can be stripped/raped of their
                        Inalienable Birth Rights and held in “Civil Custody.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Subjected to illegal, void so called “orders” called “gag orders” to silence them from
                        reporting crimes. These so called “gag orders” actually constitute crimes of blackmail and
                        extortion. Insert Link with Appendix of Crimes.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Subjected to “Extortion and Rights Raping Edicts” called by such code words as “Supervision”
                        or “Visitation” Orders; </p>
                    <p>6. Issued “no action letters” by aiding, abetting and colluding judicial government employees
                        including “appellate courts”, “attorney and judicial oversight committees” and their protection
                        arm, the “law enforcement agencies.”</p>
                    <p>When Family Members first become a Crime Victim, they are unaware the U.S. Guardian Genocide
                        Racket and Child Sex/Human Trafficking Racket are deliberate systemic Atrocity Crimes.
                        As they wade through a deliberate minefield of obstacles,cover up,retaliation and escalated attacks,
                        they realize they are embroiled in anorganized crime syndicate and cover up web and any attempt at
                        remedy is futile as the U.S. is perpetrating a War against Humanity.</p>

                        <p>1. Private Prisons conjured by government employees in collusion with such companies as GEO
                            where victims are human trafficked by false incarceration to benefit private companies in
                            which government employees are secretly invested.

                            children to detention centers in which they were invested, openly run and abetted for years

                        <p>3. Eco-Genocide Environment Rackets run in conspiracy with toxic companies like Chevron that
                            pollute and destroy the environment and collude with judicial criminals to prosecute,
                            terrorize and torture those who expose them; </p>
                        <p>4. Nuremberg Code Crimes by Big Pharma euthanasia companies such as Johnson and Johnson,
                            Moderna and Pfizer using an unending series of “vaccines” that likely produce their own
                            “Mutants” requiring further “vaccines” to pretend to cure a newly discovered unscientific
                            “Covid” disease while making billions but are unable to create a cure for long festering
                            scientific diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes. </p>
                        <p>5. Illegal “Protection Sounding Laws” like the “Patriot Act” used to cover up secret illegal
                            surveillance and torture those like Julian Assange who expose that these illegal “laws” are
                            “Crimes of Aggression” under international laws. In retaliation, Assange was Forcibly
                            Disappeared, restrained in a dungeon reminiscent of the barbaric medieval ages. In the
                            ultimate irony, Assange sought to remain in a dungeon instead of returned to the U.S. to be
                            criminalized for the crimes of the U.S. government.

                        <p>The Constitution was written in 1787 for an Agrarian Slave Society.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution held sacred was fatally flawed at its inception. Even its founders were

                    <p>We do not Consent to Tyrannical Assaults on our Human Rights and Human Dignity. As the Constitution
                        is premised on the continuing consent of the governed, when the state no
                        longer protects the rights it was intended to preserve, the consent is vitiated. When

                        5. The Electoral College is Unlawful - it overrides the vote of the People.
                    </p>
                    <p>6. The Constitution was illegally ratified, born from intimidation, and virtually impossible to
                        Amend.</p>
                    <p>7. Most top-level Federal government employee are appointed, not elected.</p>
                    <p>8. There are countless loopholes in state governments enabling the appointment, not election of state
                        government employees.</p>
                    <p>9. There are NO ENFORCEMENT mechanisms in the Constitution to its violation by government employees.
                    </p>
                    <p>10. There is no Federal Constitutionally created federal law enforcement government agency. Law
                        enforcement is not a federal Constitutional Right.</p>
                    <p>
                        11. Pursuant to the Declaration of Independence, “that to secure our rights, Governments are
                        instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” These are empty
                        words without implementation and execution provisions, therefore hypocritical and deceptive
                        propaganda creating a false government. A government's legitimacy and moral right to use state power
                        is only justified and legal when derived from the people.

                    <p>
                        12. The Constitution has lapsed. Thomas Jefferson himself made clear this fundamental, commonsense
                        principle of law. In a letter to James Madison, Jefferson states any Constitution is not binding on
                        those who are not a party; expires after 19 years and must be renewed if it is not to become “an act
                        of force and not of right”

                            Easily mesmerized by the government's political theater — endless congressional hearings
                            and investigations that go nowhere, the president's reality show antics, the warring
                            factions, electoral drama — we have become a society of watchers rather than activists
                            who are distracted by even the clumsiest government attempts at sleight-of-hand. Start
                            recognizing evil and injustice and tyranny for what it is. Stop being apathetic,
                            neutral, accomplices and distracted by the political theater staged by the Deep State:
                            they want you watching the show while they manipulate things behind the scenes.

                        <p>3. Moises Naim, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, best-selling
                            author, and internationally syndicated columnist writes:</p>
                        <p>“… these days the criminality of some political leaders has reached levels worthy of the
                            tyrants of antiquity. We are no longer talking just about “normal” corruption, as when a
                            government official gets a kickback for a weapons procurement deal or awarding a
                            lucrative
                            construction contract to a friend. Nor is it an isolated case in which the class dunce
                            arrives, to the surprise of his former colleagues, to the highest office in the land.
                            “No,
                            in a kleptocracy criminal behavior is not individual, opportunistic, or sporadic, but
                            rather
                            collective, systematic, strategic, and permanent. It is a system in which all the
                            high-level
                            government officials are complicit, where they deliberately work to enrich themselves,
                            and
                            then use their accumulated wealth to perpetuate themselves in power. Kakistocracies
                            (literally, governments by the worst) proliferate in weak and disorganized political
                            systems
                            that repel the talented and attract the inept and most debased.
