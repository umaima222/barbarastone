                    <p>It is wreaking havoc at the most immediate level, as well, creating rifts and polarities within
                        families and friends, neighborhoods and communities that keep the populace warring among
                        themselves and incapable of presenting a united front in the face of the government’s
                        goose-stepping despotism.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are definitely in desperate need of a populace that can stand united against the government’s
                        authoritarian tendencies. ….never forget our power as a citizenry comes from our ability to
                        agree and stand united on certain principles that should be non-negotiable.” Whitehead cites
                        examples of perversions of the nation’s fabric, the lives of its people and decency:</p>
                    <p> <span>1. </span> It is expected the federal deficit will surpass $1 trillion this year, not to
                        mention national debt approaching $23 trillion. There’s also $21 trillion in government spending
                        that cannot be accounted for. The U.S. government is operating in the negative on every front:
                        spending far more than it makes (and takes from American taxpayers) and borrowing heavily (from
                        foreign governments and Social Security) to keep government operating and funding its endless

                        Surely we can agree the government’s irresponsible spending, which has saddled us with
                        insurmountable debt, is pushing the country to financial and physical ruin</p>
                    <p><span>2.</span> Having been co-opted by greedy defense contractors, corrupt politicians and
                        incompetent officials, America’s expanding military is bleeding the country dry at more than $15
                        billion a month ($20 million an hour) — and that’s just what government spends on foreign wars.
                        The U.S. military’s determination to police the world has resulted in more than 1.3 million U.S.
                        troops stationed at roughly 1000 military bases in over 150 countries. That doesn’t include
                        private contractors pulling in hefty salaries at taxpayer expense. In Afghanistan, for example,
                        private contractors outnumber U.S. troops three to one.
                        No matter how we might differ about the role of U.S. military in foreign affairs, surely we can
                        agree America’s war spending and commitment to policing the world are bankrupting the nation and
                        spreading our troops dangerously thin.

                        and shields rounded up 200 handcuffed female inmates, marched them to the gymnasium, forced them
                        to strip naked (and removing tampons and pads), “bend over and spread open their vaginal and
                        anal cavities,” while male prison guards promenaded past or stood staring.

                        and a convicted felon: both are equally suspect and treated as criminals, without any of the
                        special rights and privileges reserved for the governing elite.

                        disguised as “the better good,” marketed as benevolence, enforced with armed police, and carried
                        out by an elite class of government officials who are largely insulated from the ill effects of
                        their actions. In Pennsylvania, a school district is threatening to place children in foster
                        care if parents don’t pay their overdue school lunch bills. In Florida, a resident was fined
                        $100,000 for a dirty swimming pool and overgrown grass at a house she no longer owned. In
                        Kentucky, government bureaucrats sent a cease-and-desist letter to a church ministry, warning
                        that the group is breaking the law by handing out free used eyeglasses to the homeless. These
                        petty tyrannies inflicted on an overtaxed, overregulated, and underrepresented populace are what
                        happens when bureaucrats run the show, and the rule of law becomes little more than a cattle
                        prod for forcing the citizenry to march in lockstep with the government.
                    </p>

                        and exerts authority, surely we can agree the tyranny of the Nanny State — disguised as “the
                        better good,” marketed as benevolence, enforced with armed police, and inflicted on all who do
                        not belong to the elite ruling class that gets to call the shots — should not be allowed to pave
                        over the Constitution.
                        At its core, this is not a debate about politics, or constitutionalism, or even tyranny
                        disguised as law-and-order. This is a condemnation of the monsters with human faces that have
                        infiltrated our government.

                        Yet the unavoidable truth is government has become almost indistinguishable from the evil it
                        claims to be fighting: terrorism, torture, drug or sex trafficking, murder, violence, theft,
                        pornography, scientific experimentations or other diabolical means of inflicting pain, suffering
                        and servitude on humanity.

                            devils. Yet the government can only go as far as “we the people” allow. Having allowed
                            government to expand and exceed our reach, we find ourselves on the losing end of a
                            tug-of-war over control of our country and our lives. The hour grows late in terms of

                            foreign countries as a subterfuge to seize and steal their assets and falsely arrest them
                            while making it appear the U.S. is “protecting the world from terrorism” when the U.S. is

                        <p>“It might come as a surprise to learn that the United States government has absolutely one of
                            the very worst records among all of the so called Western liberal democracies when it comes
                            to the ratification of the major multilateral human rights instruments. The U.S. government
                            has failed to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
                            (1966); the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966); the International
                            Convention of the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (1973); the
                            International Convention of the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965);
                            the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979); the
                            Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961); as this article went to press, the
                            Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crimes of Genocide (1948); and the
                            American Convention on Human Rights (1965), among others. </p>
                        <p>The refusal of the U.S. government to ratify these major international human rights treatises
                            simply demonstrates the rank hypocrisy that historically has determined the formulation of
                            U.S. human rights foreign policy: </p>
                        <p class="bold">What right does American have to preach human rights to other states,

                            occurred not only because of the machinery of death, but because of state-sanctioned
                            incitement to hate and genocide. Indeed, as the Supreme Court of Canada recognized, and as
                            echoed by the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda, the Holocaust did not begin in
                            the gas chambers -- it began with words.</p>
