                <p>refuse to say where they are. Some disappearances may be committed by armed non-state actors, like
                    armed opposition groups. And it is always a crime under international law.</p>
                <p><span>2.</span> <span class="bold">Unknown Fate :</span>These people are almost never released and
                    their fate
                    remains unknown. Victims are frequently tortured and many are killed or live in constant fear of
                    being killed. They know their families have no idea where they are and there is little chance of
                    anyone coming to help them. Even if they escape death and are eventually released, the physical and
                    psychological scars stay with them.</p>
                <p><span>3.</span> <span class="bold">Tool of Terror: </span>Enforced disappearance is frequently used
                    as a strategy
                    to spread terror within a society. The feeling of insecurity and fear it generates is not limited to
                    the close relatives of the disappeared, but also affects communities and society as a whole.</p>
                <p><span>4.</span> <span class="bold">A Global Issue: </span> Once largely used by dictatorships,
                    disappearances now
                    happen in every region of the world and in a wide range of contexts. They are commonly carried out
                    in internal conflicts, particularly by governments trying to repress political opponents or by armed
                    opposition groups.</p>
                <p><span>5.</span> <span class="bold">Who is at Risk?: </span> Human rights defenders, relatives of
                    those already disappeared, key witnesses and lawyers seem to be particular targets.</p>
                <p><span>6.</span> <span class="bold">Agony and Danger for Families :</span>Families and friends of
                    people who have disappeared experience slow mental anguish. Not knowing whether their son or
                    daughter, mother or father is still alive. Not knowing where he or she is being held, or how they
                    are being treated. Searching for the truth may put the whole family in great danger. Not knowing if
                    their loved one will ever return leaves their relatives living in limbo.</p>
                <p><span>7.</span> <span class="bold">Men Most Targeted, Women Lead the Struggle : </span> Globally, the
                    vast majority of victims of enforced disappearance are men. However it is women who most often lead
                    the struggle to find out what happened in the minutes, days and years since the disappearance –
                    putting themselves at risk for intimidation, persecution and violence. On top of this, the
                    disappeared person is often the main breadwinner, the only one able to cultivate the crops or run
                    the family business. This is then made even worse by some national laws that don’t let you draw a
                    pension or receive other support without a death certificate. </p>
                <p><span>8.</span> <span class="bold">Arbitrary Detention: </span> Many victims of enforced
                    disappearance have been arbitrarily arrested or detained – in other words arrested or detained
                    without a warrant of arrest.</p>
                <p><span>9.</span> <span class="bold">Torture: </span> A disappeared person is also at a high risk of
                    torture since they are placed completely outside the protection of the law. A victim’s lack of
                    access to legal remedies put them in a terrifying situation of complete defencelessness. Victims of
