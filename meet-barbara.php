                <p>Barbara is an attorney previously in practice for over 25 years with
                    prominent national firms in New York and Florida. Barbara resigned from the practice of law with a
                    letter of appreciation from the Bar association for her many years of service
                    and became a highly successful real estate
                    broker and Vice President of Corcoran, a prestigious national real
                    estate brokerage company. <a href="#">See testimonials attached</a>

                </p>
                <p>After Barbara resigned from practicing law, the bar association and the judicial branch of government
                    had no further jurisdiction. Yet, in violation of law and without jurisdiction, to retaliate
                    against, threaten and silence Barbara, a retired attorney, for exposing the U.S. Guardian and Child
                    Trafficking Racket, they stripped her of her no longer active “law license.” Barbara’s license was
                    stolen as this is a systemic tactic to extort vengeance against attorney who exposes the vast
                    corruption, criminality and lawlessness of the so-called “U.S. legal system.” </p>
                <p>Barbara has experienced personally and first-hand the criminality and corruption infested
                    in the government. Barbara's indoctrination into the staggering government tyranny began
                    when she and her mother became prey to the U. S. Guardian Genocide Regime All branches of government
                    are either perpetrators, their protection arm or both of the U.S. Guardian and Child Trafficking
                    Racket.<br /><br>

                    In the process of exposing the human trafficking racket run by the government using such “protection
                    sounding names” as “guardianship” and child protection, Barbara personally experienced the
                    staggering criminality, tyranny and
                    corruption infested in all government branches both on the state and federal levels and
                    throughout all echelons of government including the President, Presidential Cabinet, U.S.
                    Supreme Court, Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, F.B.I., D.O.J. and their state
                    judicial, legislative, executive and law enforcement counterparts. The more depraved the
                    crimes of a government employee, the higher up they are promoted in the hierarchy of the
                    government crime chain.
                </p>

                <p> Barbara is an outspoken Whistleblower of the unbridled atrocities, abuse of power and
                    self-serving schemes of “political criminals” who use their government office to transfer
                    the wealth of the taxpayer public to themselves and their “special interest” “special pac”
                    donors. </p>
                <p>
                    The Supreme Court is nothing more than a political operative and the protection arm
                    of government tyrants and criminals. In furtherance of and in conspiracy with the lawless,
                    government tyrants, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of illegal, void, null so
                    called “opinions” that purport to “legitimize” bribery by government officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prolific government career criminals who express the greatest “outrage” and decry the “injustice
                    system” are generally those responsible for the atrocities and the most dangerous. Thus,
                    they dually ingratiate themselves with the unsuspecting public by emulating their rage and
                    mask their criminal conspiracy with false words.
                </p>
                <p>The staggering judiciary corruption whereby lives are destroyed and possessions seized by
                    the criminal violation of fundamental human and civil rights by lawless judges is well known
                    to the public. Yet the less reported legislative and executive corruption is just as
                    pervasive and deadly. Their conspiracy, corrupt and criminal tactics are insidious,
                    bottomless and defy the sanctity of human life and humanity. These crimes, destroying
                    American families and the world public by stripping them of their rights, property, freedom,
                    livelihood and life under the auspices of the government constitute “Crimes against
                    Humanity.” Crimes against Humanity are the most severe of all crimes under international and
                    national laws, requiring independent and impartial criminal investigation and sentencing by
                    the International Criminal Court, an international court established by the United Nations
                    for this purpose.</p>

                <p> Barbara is uniquely qualified to implement this People's Rights Forum as she fully
                    understands the urgency and dangers facing the American public by the monumentally
                    tyrannical, corrupt government, having experienced it first-hand herself.</span>

                    the People and hold” criminally accountable. “government career criminals”
