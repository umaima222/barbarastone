                    <p>Barbara is an attorney previously in practice for over 25 years with
                        prominent national firms in NewYork and Florida. Barbara resigned from the practice of law
                        and became a highly successful real estate
                        broker and Vice President of Corcoran, a prestigious national real
                        estate brokerage company. See testimonials attached

                    </p>
                    <p>Barbara has experienced personally and first-hand the criminality and corruption infested
                        in the government. Barbara's indoctrination into the staggering government tyranny began
                        when she and her mother became prey to the U. S. Guardian Genocide Regime
                        <span>.</span>
                        In the process, Barbara personally experienced the staggering criminality, tyranny and
                        corruption infested in all government branches both on the state and federal levels and
                        throughout all echelons of government including the President, Presidential Cabinet, U.S.
                        SupremeCourt, Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, F.B.I., D.O.J. and their state
                        judicial, legislative, executive and law enforcement counterparts. The more depraved the
                        crimes of a government employee, the higher up he is promoted in the hierarchy of the
                        government crime chain.
                    </p>

                    <p> Barbara is an outspoken Whistleblower of the unbridled atrocities, abuse of power and
                        self-serving schemes of “political criminals” who use their government office to transfer
                        the wealth of the taxpayer public to themselves and their “special interest” “special pac”
                        donors. The Supreme Court is nothing more than a political operative and the protection arm
                        of government tyrants and criminals. In furtherance of and in conspiracy with the lawless,
                        government tyrants, theU.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of illegal, void, null so
                        called “opinions” that purport to“legitimize” bribery by government officials.Prolific
                        government career criminals who express the greatest “outrage” and decry the “injustice
                        system” are generally those responsible for the atrocities and the most dangerous. Thus,
                        they duallyingratiate themselves with the unsuspecting public by emulating their rage and
                        mask their criminal conspiracy with false words.</p>

                    <p>The staggering judiciary corruption whereby lives are destroyed and possessions seized by
                        the criminal violation of fundamental human and civil rights by lawless judges is well known
                        to the public. Yet theless reported legislative and executive corruption is just as
                        pervasive and deadly. Their conspiracy, corrupt and criminal tactics are insidious,
                        bottomless and defy the sanctity of human life and humanity. These crimes, destroying
                        American families and the world public by stripping them of their rights, property, freedom,
                        livelihood and life under the auspices of the government constitute “Crimes against
                        Humanity.” Crimes against Humanity are the most severe of all crimes under international and
                        national laws, requiring independent and impartial criminal investigation and sentencing by
                        the International Criminal Court, an international court established by the United Nations
                        for this purpose.</p>

                    <p> Barbara is uniquely qualified to implement this People's Rights Forum as she fully
                        understands the urgency and dangers facing the American public by the monumentally
                        tyrannical, corrupt government, having experienced it first-hand herself.</span>
                        As a result, she knows what must be done to Reclaim and secure the Rights of
                        the People and hold” criminally accountable.
