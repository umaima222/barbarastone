                        1. It is expected the federal deficit will surpass $1 trillion this year, not to mention
                        national debt approaching $23 trillion. There’s also $21 trillion in government spending
                        that
                        cannot be accounted for. The U.S. government is operating in the negative on every
                        front:
                        spending far more than it makes (and takes from American taxpayers) and borrowing
                        heavily (from
                        foreign governments and Social Security) to keep government operating and funding its
                        endless
                        wars abroad. Meanwhile, its sorely neglected infrastructure — railroads, water
                        pipelines, ports,
                        dams, bridges, airports and roads — is rapidly deteriorating.
                        Surely we can agree the government’s irresponsible spending, which has saddled us with
                        insurmountable debt, is pushing the country to financial and physical ruin.

                    <p>2. Having been co-opted by greedy defense contractors, corrupt politicians and
                        incompetent
                        officials, America’s expanding military is bleeding the country dry at more than $15
                        billion a
                        month ($20 million an hour) — and that’s just what government spends on foreign wars.
                        The U.S.
                        military’s determination to police the world has resulted in more than 1.3 million U.S.
                        troops
                        stationed at roughly 1000 military bases in over 150 countries. That doesn’t include
                        private
                        contractors pulling in hefty salaries at taxpayer expense. In Afghanistan, for example,
                        private
                        contractors outnumber U.S. troops three to one.</p>

                        dangerous
                        criminals to a profit-driven system that dehumanizes and strips prisoners of every
                        vestige of
                        humanity. In Illinois, as a “training exercise” prison guards armed with batons and
                        shields
                        rounded up 200 handcuffed female inmates, marched them to the gymnasium, forced them to
                        strip
                        naked (and removing tampons and pads), “bend over and spread open their vaginal and anal
                        cavities,” while male prison guards promenaded past or stood staring. </p>
                    <p> The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the entire dehumanizing, demoralizing mass body

                        — was
                        legal. Be warned: this treatment will not be limited to those behind bars.

                        deploy
                        military on American soil, the Pentagon embarked on a secret mission of “undetermined
                        duration”
                        that involves flying Black Hawk helicopters over the nation’s capital, backed by

                        standing army — this military exercise further acclimates the nation to the sight and

                        the
                        menace of a national police force — a.k.a. a standing army — vested with the power to
                        completely
                        disregard the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>7. We labor today under the weight of countless tyrannies, large and small, disguised as
                        “the
                        better good,” marketed as benevolence, enforced with armed police, and carried out by an
                        elite
                        class of government officials who are largely insulated from the ill effects of their
                        actions.
                        In Pennsylvania, a school district is threatening to place children in foster care if
                        parents
                        don’t pay their overdue school lunch bills. In Florida, a resident was fined $100,000
                        for a
                        dirty swimming pool and overgrown grass at a house she no longer owned. In Kentucky,
                        government
                        bureaucrats sent a cease-and-desist letter to a church ministry, warning that the group
                        is
                        breaking the law by handing out free used eyeglasses to the homeless. These petty
                        tyrannies
                        inflicted on an overtaxed, overregulated, and underrepresented populace are what happens
                        when
                        bureaucrats run the show, and the rule of law becomes little more than a cattle prod for
                        forcing
                        the citizenry to march in lockstep with the government.</p>
                    <p>No matter how we differ about the extent to which government has final say in how it
                        flexes power
                        and exerts authority, surely we can agree the tyranny of the Nanny State — disguised as
                        “the
                        better good,” marketed as benevolence, enforced with armed police, and inflicted on all
                        who do
                        not belong to the elite ruling class that gets to call the shots — should not be allowed
                        to pave
                        over the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>At its core, this is not a debate about politics, or constitutionalism, or even tyranny
                        disguised
                        as law-and-order. This is a condemnation of the monsters with human faces that have
                        infiltrated
                        our government.

                    <p>For too long now, the American people have rationalized turning a blind eye to all manner
                        of

                        wars, SWAT
                        team raids, militarized police, profit-driven private prisons, and so on — because they
                        were the
                        so-called lesser of two evils.</p>
                    <p>Yet the unavoidable truth is government has become almost indistinguishable from the evil

                        claims to be fighting: terrorism, torture, drug or sex trafficking, murder, violence,
                        theft,
                        pornography, scientific experimentations or other diabolical means of inflicting pain,

                        government has ripped the Constitution to shreds and left us powerless in the face
                        of its
                        power grabs, greed and brutality. What we are grappling with today is a government
                        that is
                        cutting great roads through the very foundations of freedom in order to get after
                        its modern
                        devils. Yet the government can only go as far as “we the people” allow. Having
                        allowed
                        government to expand and exceed our reach, we find ourselves on the losing end of a

                        almost
                        exclusively white, overwhelmingly male, and disproportionately conservative.

                    <p>In Kill Switch, Senate insider Adam Jentleson contends that far from reflecting the
                        Framers’
                        vision, the Senate has been transformed over the decades by a tenacious minority of
                        white
                        conservatives. From John Calhoun in the mid-1800s to Mitch McConnell in the 2010s,
                        their
                        primary weapon has been the filibuster, or the requirement that most legislation
                        secure the
                        support of a supermajority of senators. Yet, as Jentleson reveals, the filibuster
                        was not a
                        feature of the original Senate and, in allowing a determined minority to gridlock
                        the
                        federal government, runs utterly counter to the Framers’ intent. Going into the

                        backrooms where the institution’s decline is most evident, Jentleson shows that many
                        of the
                        greatest challenges of our era―partisan polarization, dark money, a media culture

                        government
                        goings-on. Lavish parties. Commitee chairmanships for sale. Pay-to-play corruption.

                        the real-life House of Cards behind the scenes in our nation's capital. Elected in
                        2014 Buck
                        realized why nothing gets done in Congress, and it isn't because of political
                        gridlock -- in
                        fact, Republicans and Democrats work together all too well to fleece taxpayers and
                        plunge
                        America deeper into debt. ''It is an insular process directed by power-hungry party
                        elites
                        who
                        live like kings and govern like bullies,'' Buck reports. Buck witnessed first-hand
                        how the
                        unwritten rules of Congress continually prioritize short-term political gain over

                <p>Persons in all countries who enter the U.S. are in danger and at risk.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Genocide, Sex and Human Trafficking Rackets make a mockery of and defiles the
                    mission of
                    the U.N. and the ICC. The U. S. besmirches the international community that respects,
                    protects
                    and treasures their elders and vulnerable citizens and endangers the humanity of the
                    global
                    society.</p>
                <p>Far from its false portrayal as a world leader, the secretive, underworld U.S. terror
                    attacks on
                    those who expose their human rights atrocities are an even greater danger and threat to
                    the
                    world than those of other countries whose atrocities are public are who are
                    hypocritically
                    attacked by meaningless rhetoric by the U.S. Every country in the world is at risk and
                    endangered. </p>
