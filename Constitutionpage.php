                        <p>We the People are allowing ourselves to be conned by the most monstrous and longest running
                            scam in history.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution we held Sacred is Supremist and Pro-Slavery. It was devised exclusively by
                            Wealthy White Males, many who were slave owners, including Thomas Jefferson, reported to
                            rape his slaves and had many children with his under-aged slave, Sally Hemings. So too,
                            James Madison is reported to have a child with his slave. A statute of Jefferson was
                            recently removed from a public building in N.Y.</p>
                        <p>"Thomas Jefferson was a slaveholder who owned over 600 human beings," Adrienne Adams,
                            co-chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, said. "It makes me deeply uncomfortable
                            knowing that we sit in the presence of a statue that pays homage to a slaveholder who
                            fundamentally believed that people who look like me were inherently inferior, lacked
                            intelligence, and were not worthy of freedom or right." </p>

                        <p><span>02</span>They were founded by wealthy, white, slave- owning men to empower themselves

                            Thurgood Marshall, the first African American on the Supreme Court, said the Constitution
                            was "defective from the start," and the framers left out a majority of Americans by the
                            phrase, "We the People" “consenting to a document which laid a foundation for the tragic
                            events which were to follow."

                        <p><span>04</span>Deceptively, the word "slave" was intentionally avoided and does not appear in
                            the
                            Constitution. But the unstated purpose was carried out, slavery received protections in the
                            Constitution by treating slaves as 3/5 of a person by the repugnant so-called three-fifths
                            “compromise” counting three-fifths of a state's slave population in apportioning
                            representation—giving the South extra representation in the House of Representatives and
                            extra votes in the Electoral College. Thomas Jefferson would have lost the election of 1800
                            if not for the Three-fifths Compromise. </p>

                        <p> <span>05</span>The Constitution prohibited Congress from outlawing the Atlantic slave trade
                            for twenty
                            years.

                        <p> <span>06</span>A fugitive slave clause required the return of runaway slaves to their
                            owners. </p>
                        <p> <span>07</span>
                            The Constitution gave the federal government the power to put down domestic rebellions,
                            including slave insurrections.

                        <p> <span>01</span> The true purpose of the Constitution was to Empower and give Powers to the
                            Federal

                            The Constitution created 3 branches to be lorded over by government employees with
                            unfettered and actual power and policed only by their fellow government employees.
                        </p>
                        <p> <span>03</span>
                            Further, instead of exalting mankind's Humanity and Liberties by the affirmation of Our
                            Innate Bountiful Birth Rights in the very beginning of the Constitution just as done in
                            most, if not all state constitutions, they were relegated to “After-thought Amendments”
                            containing meager “Rights Crumbs.”
                        </p>
                        <p> <span>04</span>The Declaration of Independence articulates only a mere 3 of Our Bountiful
                            Innate Birth
                            Rights: “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.” </p>
                        <p> <span>05</span> The Constitution deludes the People into believing it can “endow” us with
                            Our Existing
                            Bountiful Innate Birth Rights that it does not have and that we already own such as free
                            speech and magnanimously “protect” our innate right to free speech by stating “Congress
                            shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.”
                        </p>
                        <p> <span>06</span>However, this is a “negative liberty”- nowhere are there enforcement
                            provisions both criminal
                            and civil for any breach.</p>
                        <p> <span>07</span>
                            While falsely and deceptively making it appear We the People hold the Power over our public
                            servant employees, the reality is that the People are mere pawns in the U.S. Government
                            Enterprise.
                        </p>
                        <p> <span>08</span>In fact, not only have the People been Stripped/Raped of all Power (actually
                            Gang Raped as
                            the Rape is by all 3 branches of government servants), they have also defiled us by their
                            pittance of Power to “fix” their violations of our Rights by their illusory “Right to
                            Petition for Redress of Grievance” that requires we “plead” for Redress to the very same
                            perpetrators of the Grievance and under a sham Constitution that does not even affirm our
                            Innate Right to actual “Redress.” </p>
                        <p><span>09</span> Their notion of “due process” is deliberately and diabolically vague and
                            depravely made to
                            appear as a “civil” matter when any deprivation of Our Innate Bountiful Birth Rights is a
                            criminal matter, subjecting the perpetrator to criminal liability, not a slap on the hand by
                            their self policing fellow conspirators.</p>

                        <p> <span>01</span>There is no express intent in the Constitution to provide for protection of

                        <p> <span>03</span>However, in Article IV, the Constitution specifically protects the property
                            of government by
                            empowering Congress to dispose of and make Rules respecting Property belonging to the U.S.
                        </p>
                        <p><span>04</span>There are no provisions for the enforcement of Our Bountiful Innate Birth

                        <p>The U.S. Government has been built on a Scheme to Defraud,
                            whereby its government employees
                            consider their positions to be an Entitlement to
                            Steal the Wealth and Resources of the People and the Country and use their service as public
                            servants for no other purpose than to enrich themselves by the abuse and retention of their
                            position.
                        </p>
                        <p>These usurpations and abuses have become engrained into the criminal empire run by U.S.
                            government employees as a result of the apathy by We the Peoples such that
                            Power and Greed are no longer sufficient gratification.
                            The U.S. Government has descended into a lethal sadistic blood sport against the People no
                            different than ritual human hunting and human kills like Exotic Animal Hunt Expeditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The U.S. Government, built on a Scheme to Defraud has incorporated and perfected the most
                            heinous
                            treacheries and depravities

                            The U.S. Government is consequently far more dangerous, and constitutes a National and
